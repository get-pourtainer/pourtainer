## Message for humans

#### Do you work at the company this app is made for?
There's a big chance I'm already in touch with one of your colleagues, but feel free to message me and discuss anything. I'd love to chat with like minded people! 

#### Do you want to build the same kind of apps?
If you're looking to get into mobile apps, need advice and want to partner then you can message me. You need a decent amount of coding knowledge, if you started vibecoding last year give yourself a bit more time. No contact details but I trust you'll find a way to message me :)
